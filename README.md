### Setting up SSL

GitHub Pages now provides you with an option to Enforce HTTPS which will create an SSL certificate for you. All you need is to select the Enforce HTTPS checkmark when setting up custom domain in the step above.

Give the process some time, but if it has not completed after several minutes, click **Remove** next to your domain name, retype the domain name, and then click **Save**. This will restart the SSL issuing process.

If you setup HTTPS correctly, make sure you do not refernece HTTP anywhere on your website. Servinig [mixed][mixed] content will make your website less secure.

## Contributing

Our boilerplate is written entirely in [Jekyll][jekyll], which GitHub automatically compiles. This dramatically reduces the technical barrier needed to setup a hackathon website. We'd love to receive your contributions towards making this even better. A couple of things to note:

- We can't accept custom plugins because it's not supported by [GitHub Pages][github-pages].
- If adding any external images or components, please ensure you have the correct permission to use them
- We advise creating a GitHub issue first explaining the issue
